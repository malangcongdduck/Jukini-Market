### <strong>Fresh crop direct market website harvested in rural areas within 24 hours</strong>
<p>
  <strong>People who farm themselves can easily get fresh crops. But if there are more crops left than necessary, what should I do?</strong></br>
Inspired by the carrot market, our team has implemented a website that anyone can easily sell if they grow crops. The goal was to build a platform where you can get crops that are cheaper and safer than marts. In addition, for the purpose of maintaining freshness, it is implemented so that only products can be purchased within 24 hours of registration, and the seller can check the sales details and the buyer can check the purchase details. And similar to home shopping, we also included a function for self-marketing so that anyone can see the details of real-time purchases so that sellers can easily sell them.
